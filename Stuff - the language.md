# Stuff - the language

### Accepted characters
In the range of `0x21` to `0x7E`

### Variables

Variables are `!`, `"`, `#`, ... all the way to `~`.

#### Initializing/Setting a variable
The variables are initially undefined, to use them, you must initialize them. The example program sets the variable `a` to `Hi`.

```
!aS02Hi
```

The assignment opcode is `!`. Then we have the variable name, `a`. Then we have the type, `S` (a string).

| Opcode | Definition      | Example    | Description                                      | Variable value |
|--------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `S`    | String          | `!aS02Hi`  | Sets the variable `a` to a String of length `2`  | `Hi`           |
| `n`    | Unsigned number | `!an3101`  | Sets the variable `a` to a uNumber of length `3` | `101`          |
| `N`    | Signed number   | `!aN3-101` | Sets the variable `a` to a sNumber of length `3` | `-101`         |
| `s`    | Charecter       | `!as[`     | Sets the variable `a` to a Char                  | `[`            |
| `u`    | Undefined       | `!au`      | Undefines/Clears the variable `a`                |                |
| `B`    | Boolean         | `!aBt`     | Sets the variable `a` to a Bool                  | `true`         |

Note: with a `sNumber`, for a positive number, write `!aN3+101` (sets `a` to `101`)
Note: with a `Bool`, for `false`, write `!aBf` (sets `a` to `false`)

#### Copying variables

You can copy variables to other ones. For example if you want to copy the variable `Z` to the variable `@`:

```
"Z@
```

### Addition

If you want to add `@` to `#` and store the result in `@` then you could do:

```
#@#
```

Where `#` is the operation and `@` and `#` are the two operands.

### Subtraction

If you want to subtract `@` with `#` and store the result in `@` then you could do:

```
$@#
```

Where `$` is the operation and `@` and `#` are the two operands.

### Multiplication

If you want to multiply `@` with `#` and store the result in `@` then you could do:

```
%@#
```

Where `%` is the operation and `@` and `#` are the two operands.

### Division

If you want to divide `@` by `#` and store the result in `@` then you could do:

```
&@#
```

Where `%` is the operation and `@` and `#` are the two operands.

### Exponents

If you want to exponentiate `@` with `#` and store the result in `@` then you could do:

```
'@#
```

Where `&` is the operation and `@` and `#` are the two operands.

### Whitespace

Spaces, tabs, and newlines only **between operation groups** are allowed.

For example, the following is valid:

```
!aS12Hello World!

    *a
```

But the following is **not**:

```
!  a S 12Hello World!  
   *   a
```

### Comments

Comments are defined by `~`, followed by their length.

Ex.:

```
~07 Hello!
~02Hi
~10 very long
```

If you would like a string *longer* than 99 charecters, just do multiple comments

```
~99veryveryveryveryvery (etc) very~20veryverylong string!
```

### Output

To print the value of the variable `$`:

```
*$
```

### Str-to-int

To convert a string (in `@`) to an integer (written to `@`):

```
(@
```

### Int-to-str

To convert a integer (in `@`) to an string (written to `@`):

```
)@
```

### Output without trailing newline

To print the value of the variable `$` (without the trailing newline):

```
+$
```

### Input

To write the user input to the variable `$`:

```
,$
```

### Delay

To delay the program 1 second (1000ms):

```
-00001000
```

### Loops

To print the content of the variable `$` 10 times:

```
.010<*$>
```

### If statements

If you want to print the content of the variable `!` if the variable `R` is equal to the variable `J`, you can do:

```
/R=J<*!>
```

| Opcode | Definition            | Example    |
|--------|-----------------------|------------|
| `=`    | Equal to              | `/R=J<*!>` |
| `>`    | Greater than          | `/R>J<*!>` |
| `<`    | Smaller than          | `/R<J<*!>` |
| `g`    | Greater or equal than | `/RgJ<*!>` |
| `l`    | Smaller or equal than | `/RlJ<*!>` |
| `!`    | Not equal to          | `/R!J<*!>` |

### The rest

Reserved for expansion (returns a FutureWarning)

```
WARNING: FutureWarning: opcode 'I' not defined
```

### Warnings

`FutureWarning` : undefined opcode that may be used in the future
`DepricatedWarning`: opcode that is not in use anymore

### Errors

`InvalidOpcodeError` : invalid opcode outside of the `0x21` - `0x7E` range
`InvalidArgsError` : invalid arguments for an opcode
`InvalidTypeError` : invalid type for operation, e.g. you can't add a string to a boolean

### Planned expansions

- input
- functions
- modules (import, export)
- file i/o
- classes
- gui (tkinter?)
